**Summary:**
There seems to be a miscommunication between the speaker and their colleague, David, about the topic of discussion. The speaker thought they would be discussing AI, but David prepared a story about Snoep instead. The speaker suggests a compromise, where David shares his story about Snoep, and then the speaker will share information about an AI project, hoping to find some parallels between the two topics.

**To-Do List:**

1. David shares his story about Snoep.
2. The speaker shares information about the AI project.
3. Attempt to find parallels between the story about Snoep and the AI project.
4. Adapt the discussion to combine both topics, as initially planned.
